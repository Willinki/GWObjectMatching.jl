* References for algorithms to be used

** General reference on graph

This page contains useful stuff to deal with graphs
[[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/][Useful page]]

** General reference on random graph generation

Still to be added.

** General reference on graph matching

This paper provides a general overview of the topic:
[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1493.pdf][Link to arxiv]]

** Exact graph matching - Main ones
- nauty algorithm
- traces algorithm 

  Both are described [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1493.pdf][Here]],.

  I think we should aim at implementing these two, with the other coming if we have time.

** Exact graph matching - Additional ones
- Bliss algorithm
- Saucy algorithm
- Conauto algorithm
